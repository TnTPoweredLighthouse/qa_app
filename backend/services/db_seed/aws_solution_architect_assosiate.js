However, the application’s performance is impacted. Your manager asks you how to improve the performance and availability of the application. Which of the following AWS services would you recommend? 

A. AWS DataSync
B. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator
C. AWS Lake Formation
D. AWS Global Accelerator`,
        answer: `Answer: D

AWS Global accelerator provides static IP addresses that are anycast in the AWS edge network. Incoming traffic is distributed across endpoints in AWS regions. The performance and availability of the application are improved.

Option A is incorrect: Because DataSync is a tool to automate the data transfer and does not help to improve the performance.

Option B is incorrect: DynamoDB is not mentioned in this question.

Option C is incorrect: Because AWS Lake Formation is used to manage a large amount of data in AWS which would not help in this situation.

Option D is CORRECT: Check the AWS Global Accelerator use cases. The Global Accelerator service can improve both application performance and availability.`

        Options:
        
        A. The instance will still launch without needing the original AMI.
        B. The instance will start, but a new AMI won't be generated.
        C. AWS will automatically create a new AMI and proceed with the launch.
        D. An error will occur, indicating that the required AMI has been deregistered.`,
        answer: `Explanation:
        
        When a user tries to replicate an EC2 instance using "Launch More Like This," the process relies on the linked AMI. If the AMI is deleted or deregistered, AWS cannot launch the new instance, resulting in an error indicating the AMI is unavailable.

        B. Read Replica
        C. Multi-region
        D. PostgreSQL does not support High Availability`,
        answer: `Explanation:
        
        To ensure High Availability for a PostgreSQL database on AWS, Multi-AZ deployment is the best solution. It automatically creates a standby replica in another Availability Zone and switches to it if the primary instance fails, ensuring minimal downtime.

        Options:
        
        A. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses strong encryption standards, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).
        B. Server-side encryption ensures that your data is encrypted while it is being transmitted over the internet.
        C. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 manages the encryption and decryption processes, including the encryption keys.
        D. Server-side encryption pertains to data encryption at rest, where Amazon S3 encrypts data as it is stored on disk.`
        , answer: `Explanation:
        
        Server - side encryption in Amazon S3 is for encrypting data at rest, not during transit.Data encryption during transmission is handled by SSL / TLS.Therefore, option B is incorrect because it conflates encryption at rest with encryption in transit.

        Options:
        
        A. Enable Multi-AZ deployment for the RDS instance to replicate data across regions.
        B. Set up Read Replicas in different regions to copy the data from the primary RDS instance.
        C. Use Amazon S3 for storing database snapshots and replicate them across regions.
        D. Implement cross-region replication with AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).`,
        answer: `Explanation:
        
        Setting up Read Replicas in different regions is a valid approach for replicating data across multiple geographic locations. This method allows the RDS instance to asynchronously replicate data to other regions, ensuring data availability in different locations.
